fixes:
  - |
    DB's columns started_at and finished_at are defined as float type,
    as result timestamp doesn't fit into default Float size. This change
    migrates columns type to DateTime.
upgrade:
  - |
    New migration from Float to DateTime consists data migration,
    which could take some time, based on the number of introspection
    statuses in DB.
