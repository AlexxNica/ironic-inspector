    Added an API access policy enforcment (based on oslo.policy rules).
    Similar to other OpenStack services, operators now can configure
    fine-grained access policies using ``policy.yaml`` file.
    See example ``policy.yaml.sample`` file included in the code tree
    for the list of available policies and their default rules.
    This file can also be generated from the code tree
    with ``tox -egenpolicy`` command.

    See ``oslo.policy`` package documentation for more information
    on using and configuring API access policies.

upgrade:
  - |
    Due to the choice of default values for API access policies rules,
    some API parts of the ironic-inspector service will become available
    to wider range of users after upgrade:

      - general access to the whole API is by default granted to a user
        with either ``admin``, ``administrator`` or ``baremetal_admin``
        role (previously it allowed access only to a user with ``admin``
        role)
      - listing of current introspections and showing a given
        introspection is by default also allowed to the user with the
        ``baremetal_observer`` role

    If these access policies are not suiting a given deployment before
    upgrade, operator will have to create a ``policy.json`` file
    in the inspector configuration folder (usually ``/etc/inspector``)
    that redefines the API rules as required.

    See ``oslo.policy`` package documentation for more information
    on using and configuring API access policies.
